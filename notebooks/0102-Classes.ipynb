    "C# is an object-oriented language in which everything is an object, with the type `object` as the most basic types that all other types inherit from. In this session, we will learn to create our own types and how they can relate to other types using Interfaces and various scopes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Memory with C# and .NET is dynamically allocated and reclaimed by the .NET runtime as you no longer reference variables.  The .NET **Garbage Collector** runs occasionally, freeing memory that was previously used by variables.  There are ways to tune the garbage collector and in-depth studies of how it manages memory that are much more advanced than this part of the series.  If you'd like to read more, check the [official .NET garbage collector documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals?WT.mc_id=visualstudio-twitch-jefritz)\n",
